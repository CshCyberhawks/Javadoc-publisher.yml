```YAML

  push:
    branches:
      - master
      - main

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: actions/setup-java@v2
        with:
          java-version: 17
          distribution: 'adopt'
      - name: Generate Javadoc
        run: mvn org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-javadoc-plugin:3.3.1:aggregate
      - name: Deploy ðŸš€
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@3.5.9
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          BRANCH: javadoc
          CLEAN: true
          FOLDER: target/site/apidocs
          TARGET_FOLDER: javadoc
```

### Your Java version is not 17 ?

If your Java project is not in Java 17, don't forget to modify that line:
```YAML
      uses: actions/setup-java@v2
      with:
        distribution: 'adopt'
        java-version: 17
```
